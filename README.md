# E-Commerce App - React Native

## Overview

This is a **basic shopping store app** built with **React Native** and **Firebase**. The app is designed to explore React Native development and gain hands-on experience with mobile app development workflows, user authentication, real-time database handling, and more.

The app integrates Firebase for user authentication, cart functionality, and real-time data management.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign up, login, and logout using Firebase Authentication.
- **Product Listing**: Display a list of products with details (name, price, image).
- **Cart Functionality**: Add items to the cart, remove items, and update item quantities.
- **Real-Time Data**: Firebase Firestore used for real-time database interaction, keeping the data synchronized across devices.
- **Responsive UI**: Mobile-first design with a clean and user-friendly interface.

## Tech Stack

- **React Native**: For building cross-platform mobile applications.
- **Firebase**: For user authentication, real-time database management, and data synchronization.
- **React Navigation**: For handling navigation within the app.
- **Expo**: A development platform for building React Native apps, making the setup easier.
